# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# JourneyGraph — the DAG model that replaces the nested "tree" journey.
#
# A journey is a directed ACYCLIC graph of nodes:
#   { "start": <id>, "nodes": { <id>: Node, ... } }
#
#   Node = {
#     "type": "round" | "shop" | "storyboard" | "fork",
#     "data": Dictionary,   # item payload — the round/shop/storyboard fields, or for
#                           #   a fork: title/description/resolution/cond_metric/default_path
#     "out":  Array,        # outgoing edges; 0 = an end, 1 = linear, N = fork choices
#   }
#   Edge = { "to": <id>, ...fork-choice config: name/description/image_path/
#                            weight/threshold/required_item/cost }
#
# Non-fork nodes have exactly one out-edge (or zero = an end). Fork nodes have
# one out-edge per choice, each carrying that choice's resolution config. `to == ""`
# (or an empty `out`) terminates the journey.
#
# DAG-only: edges only ever point "forward" (guaranteed here by migration; enforced
# by the builder later). Pure data — no UI, no node state. Mirrors the
# ForkResolver / JourneyData / JourneyScanner split.
#
# `node.data` is shape-compatible with GameState's sequence items ({type,data}), so
# the runtime can read CurrentRound()/CurrentShop()/… straight off a node.
